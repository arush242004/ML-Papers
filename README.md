# ML-Papers
Cool and interesting ML papers that I will implement. The areas of ML touched will be diverse, but I will hope to narrow it down to Reinforcement Learning. I will also strive to upload the paper that I'm implementing itself.

For npw, I am interested in Optimizers.

[ ] Stochastic Gradient Descent
[ ] Adam
[ ] Gravity
... and tons more!
