# ML-Papers
Cool and interesting ML papers that I will implement. The areas of ML touched will be diverse, but I will hope to narrow it down to Reinforcement Learning. I will also strive to upload the paper that I'm implementing itself.

For now, I am interested in optimizers.

### Optimizers that I will focus on for now:
- [ ] SGD
- [ ] Adam
- [ ] Gravity
- [ ] APOLLO

...tons more to follow!

(Optimizers are my *main* focus for now. I, however, will switch up and implement papers randomly, out of my pure interest. Sometimes these can be things like genetic algorithms, other times they can be new architectures!)
