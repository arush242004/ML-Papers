# ML-Papers
Cool and interesting ML papers that I will implement. The areas of ML touched will be diverse, but I will hope to narrow it down to Reinforcement Learning. I will also strive to upload the paper that I'm implementing itself.

For now, I am interested in Optimizers.

### Optimizers that I will focus on for now:
- [ ] SGD
- [ ] Adam
- [ ] Gravity
...tons more to follow!
